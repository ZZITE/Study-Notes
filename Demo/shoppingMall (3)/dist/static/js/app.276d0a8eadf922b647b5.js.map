It stresses the design of dimensionally geometrical lines. In terms of material, the bags are made of the first layer of cowhide leather or sheepskin with scratch and scar, which feels soft. The concept of design is to emphasize the idea of Simplicity by the contrast between the cross-cutting Design material and texture.
